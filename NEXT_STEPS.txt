║                     NEXT STEPS - ACTION PLAN                     


 GOAL: Generate AWS Security Group Audit Report

 PREREQUISITES (Already Complete!)
    Python 3.11.9 installed
    All dependencies installed
    Project structure created
    Code validated and ready



STEP 1: COLLECT DATA IN AWS CONSOLE


1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: https://console.aws.amazon.com
3. Sign in to your AWS account
4. Click the CloudShell icon (>_) in the top navigation bar
   (Usually next to the bell icon on the right side)
5. Wait for CloudShell to initialize

6. Upload the data collection script:
    Click "Actions"  "Upload file"
    Select: scripts/collect_sg_data.sh
    Wait for upload to complete

7. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x collect_sg_data.sh

8. Run the script:
   bash collect_sg_data.sh

9. Wait for completion (may take 5-15 minutes depending on regions)
    You'll see progress for each region
    Script will display summary at the end

10. Download the JSON file:
     Look for: sg_audit_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
     Click "Actions"  "Download file"
     Enter the filename shown
     Save to your project folder



STEP 2: GENERATE REPORT LOCALLY


1. Open PowerShell in this directory:
   C:\Users\KishoreKumarM\OneDrive - Nexsys One DMCC\Krishz - NexsysOne\Development\AWS Security

2. Run the report generator:
   python run_audit.py <downloaded_json_filename>

   Example:
   python run_audit.py sg_audit_data_20260112_143022.json

3. Wait for report generation (1-5 minutes)
    Analysis will process all regions
    Charts will be generated
    HTML and PDF reports will be created

4. Open your reports:
    Navigate to: output/ folder
    Open: security_report_*.html (in browser)
    Or:   security_report_*.pdf (for sharing)



 WHAT YOU'LL GET


Professional PDF/HTML report containing:

 Executive Summary
   Total security groups analyzed
   Risk distribution (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   Visual charts and graphs

 Critical Findings ( Immediate Action)
   Databases exposed to internet
   All ports open to 0.0.0.0/0
   Specific remediation steps

 High Risk Findings ( Urgent)
   SSH/RDP exposed to internet
   Management ports without restrictions
   Actionable recommendations

 Medium/Low Findings ()
   Other security concerns
   Best practice violations

 Unused Resources (ℹ)
   Security groups with no attachments
   Optimization opportunities



  TROUBLESHOOTING


Issue: PDF generation fails on Windows
Fix:   1. Install GTK+ runtime from:
          https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer
       2. Or use HTML report and browser "Print to PDF"

Issue: AWS CloudShell script fails
Fix:   1. Check IAM permissions (need EC2 read-only)
       2. Ensure region is enabled
       3. Try running in different region

Issue: Python module not found
Fix:   Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
